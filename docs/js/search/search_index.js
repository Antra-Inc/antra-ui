Password textbox does validations of required\n * and strong password pattern where as Confirm Password textbox does validations\n * of required and matches with password textbox value.\n *\n * There are four **Input properties, passwordValidationMessage and\n * confirmPasswordValidationMessage**, They are used to assign\n * custom validation messages to **password and confirm password field**\n * from end user where as **Input properties, userName and email address** will hold\n * the user who has logged-in whose user name and email address for which user wishes\n * to update the password.\n *\n * * There is another input property known as **passwordPattern**, you can pass any\n * custom pattern from application.\n * * For e.g: **[passwordPattern]='^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9]).{8,}$'**.\n * Default pattern is '^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9]).{8,}$', checks for 1 uppercase,\n * 1 lowercase, 1 number and total length should be minimum 8 characters long.\n *\n * There is an **Output event** named passwordResetActionEvent, on click of **SUBMIT** button,\n * it will emit object of passwordResetActions which includes submit action name as a\n * string **ChangePassword [action type], email address,\n * password and confirm password**\n *\n * ### Usage\n *  `import { AntraUiModule } from 'antra-ui';`\n */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'antra-change-password',\n  templateUrl: './change-password.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./change-password.component.scss'],\n})\n/**\n * Example of usage:\n * https://antra-inc.github.io/Antra-ui/components/change-password\n */\nexport class ChangePasswordComponent implements OnInit {\n  @Input() userName;\n  @Input() emailAddress;\n  // receiving customized validation messages from end user\n  @Input() passwordValidationMessage;\n  @Input() confirmPasswordValidationMessage;\n  @Input() passwordPattern = '^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9]).{8,}$';\n\n  // emitting passwordResetActionEvent SUBMIT action to end user\n  @Output() passwordResetActionEvent = new EventEmitter();\n\n  resetPwdModel = new ResetPasswordModel();\n  passwordResetActions: PasswordResetActions;\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  constructor(private customValidationService: CustomValidationService) {}\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n    this.customValidationService.passwordPattern = this.passwordPattern;\n  }\n\n  // tslint:disable-next-line: typedef\n  onSubmit() {\n    this.resetPwdModel.email = this.emailAddress;\n\n    this.passwordResetActions = {\n      actionType: 'ChangePassword',\n      email: this.resetPwdModel.email,\n      password: this.resetPwdModel.password,\n      confirmPassword: this.resetPwdModel.confirmPassword,\n    };\n    this.passwordResetActionEvent.emit(this.passwordResetActions);\n  }\n}\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n  \n    Hi, {{ userName }} !\n    Please create new Password\n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        \n           error_outline  {{ passwordValidationMessage[0] }}\n        \n        \n           error_outline  {{ passwordValidationMessage[1] }}\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n           error_outline  {{ confirmPasswordValidationMessage[0] }}\n        \n        \n           error_outline  {{ confirmPasswordValidationMessage[1] }}\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        SUBMIT\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ./change-password.component.scss\n                \n                \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n                no-iframes\n            \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '      Hi, {{ userName }} !

component provides a default login interface with email address field, password field and\nfour login actions in which one is FORGOT PASSWORD link and rest 3 are buttons: LOGIN button, GMAIL button\n& OFFICE365 button. Email address textbox does validations of required and valid email address.\nPassword textbox does validations of required.\nNote:\nPassword should have minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter and 1 number\nThere are two Input properties,  emailAddressValidationMessage and passwordValidationMessage, they are used to assign\ncustom validation messages to email address field and password field from end user.\nThere is another input property known as passwordPattern, you can pass any custom pattern from application.\nFor e.g: [passwordPattern]='^(?=.?[A-Z])(?=.?[a-z])(?=.?[0-9]).{8,}$'.\nDefault pattern is '^(?=.?[A-Z])(?=.?[a-z])(?=.?[0-9]).{8,}$',\nchecks for 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number and total length should be minimum 8 characters long.\nThere is another input property known as emailPattern, you can pass any custom pattern from application.\nFor e.g: [emailPattern]='^[a-zA-Z0-9+.-]+[@]?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$'.\nDefault pattern is '^[a-zA-Z0-9+.-]+[@]?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$',\nchecks for Alphanumeric characters, along with 0 or more special characters like '_','.'.\nYou can use 0 or 1 time '@' symbol .\nThere is another input property known as emailPlaceHolder, where you can provide placeholder for Email Address TextField.\nDefault value is 'User Name'. If you want to customize it to Email Address or any thing, then you can do that.\nThere are another three Input properties, such as loginUsingOption, loginUsingGmail and loginUsingOffice365.\nThey set default to false, meaning they are invisible to user.\nIf you apply true, then they will become visible.\nThere is an Output event named loginActionEvent, it will emit login action names as a string such as 'FORGOTPASSWORD',\n'GMAIL' & 'OFFICE365' based on end user clicks. It gives object of loginActions which includes actionType, email and password.\nNote:\nWhen you click on LOGIN button, it will first validate provided email address and password and\nthen it will emit validated email address and password as the result.\nBased on the returned results of login actions [FORGOT PASSWORD link, LOGIN button, GMAIL button & OFFICE365 button],\nend user will implement their custom logic.\nNote:\nThere is an Input type, 'loginUsingOption' which will take boolean value. If it is false,\nyou will not be able to see Login Using option, it will hide Login using text, Gmail and Office365 buttons. Bydefault is true.\nNote:\nThere are two additional Input properties, such as showLoginError, default to False and loginErrorMessage to show\nvariety of error messages based on login failures. For Instance, Invalid Credentials, Emaild Id does not exist, etc\nNote: If you turn showLoginError to true, then loginErrorMessage will become visible.\nUsage\n  import { AntraUiModule } from

component provides a default login interface with **email address field, password field** and\n * four **login actions** in which one is **FORGOT PASSWORD** link and rest 3 are buttons: **LOGIN button, GMAIL button\n * & OFFICE365 button**. Email address textbox does validations of required and valid email address.\n * Password textbox does validations of required.\n *\n * **Note:**\n * *Password should have minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter and 1 number*\n *\n * There are two **Input properties,  emailAddressValidationMessage and passwordValidationMessage**, they are used to assign\n * custom validation messages to **email address field and password field** from end user.\n *\n * There is another **input property known as passwordPattern**, you can pass any custom pattern from application.\n * **For e.g:** [passwordPattern]='^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9]).{8,}$'.\n * Default pattern is '^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9]).{8,}$',\n * checks for **1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number and total length should be minimum 8 characters long.**\n *\n * There is another **input property known as emailPattern**, you can pass any custom pattern from application.\n * **For e.g:** [emailPattern]='^[a-zA-Z0-9+_.-]+[@]?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$'.\n * Default pattern is '^[a-zA-Z0-9+_.-]+[@]?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$',\n * checks for **Alphanumeric characters, along with 0 or more special characters like '_','.'.\n * You can use 0 or 1 time '@' symbol .**\n *\n * There is another **input property known as emailPlaceHolder**, where you can provide placeholder for Email Address TextField.\n * Default value is 'User Name'. If you want to customize it to Email Address or any thing, then you can do that.\n *\n * There are another three **Input properties, such as loginUsingOption, loginUsingGmail and loginUsingOffice365**.\n * They set default to **false**, meaning they are invisible to user.\n *\n * If you apply **true**, then they will become **visible**.\n *\n * There is an **Output event** named loginActionEvent, it will emit login action names as a string such as **'FORGOTPASSWORD',\n * 'GMAIL' & 'OFFICE365'** based on end user clicks. It gives object of loginActions which includes actionType, email and password.\n *\n * **Note:**\n * When you click on LOGIN button, it will first validate provided email address and password and\n * then it will emit validated email address and password as the result.\n *\n * Based on the returned results of **login actions [FORGOT PASSWORD link, LOGIN button, GMAIL button & OFFICE365 button]**,\n * end user will implement their custom logic.\n *\n * **Note:**\n * There is an Input type, 'loginUsingOption' which will take boolean value.
