component provides a default login interface with email address field, password field and\nfour login actions in which one is FORGOT PASSWORD link and rest 3 are buttons: LOGIN button, GMAIL button\n& OFFICE365 button. Email address textbox does validations of required and valid email address.\nPassword textbox does validations of required.\nNote:\nPassword should have minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter and 1 number\nThere are two Input properties,  emailAddressValidationMessage and passwordValidationMessage, they are used to assign\ncustom validation messages to email address field and password field from end user.\nThere is another input property known as passwordPattern, you can pass any custom pattern from application.\nFor e.g: [passwordPattern]='^(?=.?[A-Z])(?=.?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9]).{8,}$', checks for 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, \n1 number and total length should be minimum 8 characters long.\nThere is another input property known as emailPattern, you can pass any custom pattern from application.\nFor e.g: [emailPattern]='^[a-zA-Z0-9+.-]+[@]?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$'.\nDefault pattern is '^[a-zA-Z0-9+.-]+[@]?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$',\nchecks for Alphanumeric characters, along with 0 or more special characters like '_','.'.\nYou can use 0 or 1 time '@' symbol .\nThere is another input property known as emailPlaceHolder, where you can provide placeholder for Email Address TextField.\nDefault value is 'User Name'. If you want to customize it to Email Address or any thing, then you can do that.\nThere are another three Input properties, such as loginUsingOption, loginUsingGmail and loginUsingOffice365.\nThey set default to false, meaning they are invisible to user.\nIf you apply true, then they will become visible.\nThere is an Output event named loginActionEvent, it will emit login action names as a string such as 'FORGOTPASSWORD',\n'GMAIL' & 'OFFICE365' based on end user clicks. It gives object of loginActions which includes actionType, email and password.\nNote:\nWhen you click on LOGIN button, it will first validate provided email address and password and\nthen it will emit validated email address and password as the result.\nBased on the returned results of login actions [FORGOT PASSWORD link, LOGIN button, GMAIL button & OFFICE365 button],\nend user will implement their custom logic.\nNote:\nThere is an Input type, 'loginUsingOption' which will take boolean value. If it is false,\nyou will not be able to see Login Using option, it will hide Login using text, Gmail and Office365 buttons. Bydefault is true.\nNote:\nThere are two additional Input properties, such as showLoginError, default to False and loginErrorMessage to show\nvariety of error messages based on login failures. For Instance, Invalid Credentials, Emaild Id does not exist, etc\nNote: If you turn showLoginError to true, then loginErrorMessage will become visible.\nUsage\n  import { AntraUiModule } from

If you want to customize it to Email Address or any thing, then you can do that.\n *\n * There are another three **Input properties, such as loginUsingOption, loginUsingGmail and loginUsingOffice365**.\n * They set default to **false**, meaning they are invisible to user.\n *\n * If you apply **true**, then they will become **visible**.\n *\n * There is an **Output event** named loginActionEvent, it will emit login action names as a string such as **'FORGOTPASSWORD',\n * 'GMAIL' & 'OFFICE365'** based on end user clicks. It gives object of loginActions which includes actionType, email and password.\n *\n * **Note:**\n * When you click on LOGIN button, it will first validate provided email address and password and\n * then it will emit validated email address and password as the result.\n *\n * Based on the returned results of **login actions [FORGOT PASSWORD link, LOGIN button, GMAIL button & OFFICE365 button]**,\n * end user will implement their custom logic.\n *\n * **Note:**\n * There is an Input type, 'loginUsingOption' which will take boolean value. If it is false,\n * you will not be able to see Login Using option, it will hide Login using text, Gmail and Office365 buttons. Bydefault is true.\n *\n * **Note:**\n * There are two additional **Input properties, such as showLoginError, default to False and loginErrorMessage to show\n * variety of error messages based on login failures**. For Instance, Invalid Credentials, Emaild Id does not exist, etc\n *\n * Note: If you turn showLoginError to true, then loginErrorMessage will become visible.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *  `import { AntraUiModule } from 'antra-ui';`\n */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'antra-login',\n  templateUrl: './login.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./login.component.scss'],\n})\n/**\n * Example of usage:\n * https://antra-inc.github.io/Antra-ui/components/login\n */\nexport class LoginComponent implements OnInit {\n  // receiving customized validation messages from end user\n  @Input() emailAddressValidationMessage;\n  @Input() passwordValidationMessage;\n\n  @Input() emailPlaceHolder = 'User Name';\n  @Input() showLoginError = false;\n  @Input() loginErrorMessage;\n  @Input() passwordPattern = '';\n  @Input() emailPattern = '^[a-zA-Z0-9+_.-]+[@]?[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$';\n  @Input() loginUsingOption = false;\n  @Input() loginUsingGmail = false;\n  @Input() loginUsingOffice365 = false;\n\n  // emitting login actions to end user\n  @Output() loginActionEvent = new EventEmitter();\n\n  loginModel = new Login();\n  loginActions: LoginActions;\n\n  errorMessage: string;\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  constructor(private customValidationService: CustomValidationService) {}\n\n  // tslint:disable-next-line: typedef\n  onSubmit() {\n    this.loginActions = {\n      actionType: 'Login',\n      email: this.loginModel.email,\n      password: this.loginModel.password,\n    };\n    this.loginActionEvent.emit(this.loginActions);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n    this.customValidationService.passwordPattern = this.passwordPattern;\n    this.customValidationService.emailPattern = this.emailPattern;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  // tslint:disable-next-line: typedef\n  sendLoginActionName(actionType: LoginActionType) {\n    this.loginActions = {\n      actionType,\n      email: null,\n      password: null,\n    };\n    this.loginActionEvent.emit(this.loginActions);\n  }\n}\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        \n           error_outline  {{ emailAddressValidationMessage[0] }}\n        \n        \n           error_outline  {{ emailAddressValidationMessage[1] }}\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n           error_outline  {{ passwordValidationMessage[0] }}\n        \n        \n           error_outline  {{ passwordValidationMessage[1] }}\n        \n      \n      \n         error_outline {{ loginErrorMessage }}\n      \n    \n    \n      LOGIN\n    \n    \n      \n        Forgot Password?\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n      \n        \n          Login using\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Gmail\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Office 365\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ./login.component.scss\n                \n                .form-container {\n  padding: 30px;\n}\n\n.form-actions {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  .form-actions__item {\n    flex: 1;\n    margin-right: 5px;\n  }\n}\n\n.form__label-color-grey {\n  margin: 10px 0;\n  color: darkgrey;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n.form__button-img {\n  text-align: left;\n  width: 22px;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  margin-right: 10px;\n  margin-bottom: 2px;\n  border-radius: 0px;\n}\n.form__column button {\n  outline: none;\n}\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n            \n                no-iframes\n            \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '                                     error_outline  {{ emailAddressValidationMessage[0] }}                           error_outline  {{ emailAddressValidationMessage[1] }}                                                     error_outline  {{ passwordValidationMessage[0] }}                           error_outline  {{ passwordValidationMessage[1] }}                             error_outline {{ loginErrorMessage }}                    LOGIN                      Forgot Password?

notification dialog box interface through \nwhich you can show Success message or Error message to the end user. This dialog box interface also contains\nthe success-icon, error-icon, message and optional button to redirect to another component.\nThere are several Input properties defined for this component. Input property,  successMessage, it is used to receive successful\nmessage from end user after we succeed with any operation. For instance, response we get on api call. \nInput property,  errorMessage, it is used to \nreceive error message from end user incase of any error during any intended operation.\nInput property,  notificationStatus, it will hold boolean value. On true value, you will get Success Icon with optional\nsuccess message and redirect button. On false value, you will get Error Icon with optional error message and redirect button. \nDefaults to true.\nInput property,  btnText, it is used to apply user friendly text to button from the end user.\nNOTE:  Input property,  showRedirectButton, it is set default to false,\nmeaning button is invisible to user. If you apply true, then it will become visible.\nThere is an Output event named sendNotificationEvent, on click\nof CLICK HERE TO LOGIN button, it will emit btnText input property value as as string. For instance, you have defined a button \nwith value as CLICK HERE TO LOGIN, it will emit it's value as string to the end user on click of this button. \nUsage\n  import { AntraUiModule } from

show Success message or Error message to the end user. This dialog box interface also contains\n * the **success-icon, error-icon, message and optional button to redirect to another component**.\n *\n * There are several **Input properties** defined for this component. **Input property,  successMessage**, it is used to receive successful\n * message from end user after we succeed with any operation. **For instance,** response we get on api call. \n * \n * **Input property,  errorMessage**, it is used to \n * receive error message from end user incase of any error during any intended operation.\n * \n * **Input property,  notificationStatus**, it will hold boolean value. On true value, you will get Success Icon with optional\n * success message and redirect button. On false value, you will get Error Icon with optional error message and redirect button. \n * Defaults to true.\n * \n * **Input property,  btnText**, it is used to apply user friendly text to button from the end user.\n *\n * **NOTE:**  **Input property,  showRedirectButton**, it is set default to **false**,\n * meaning button is invisible to user. If you apply **true**, then it will become **visible**.\n *\n * There is an **Output event** named sendNotificationEvent, on click\n * of **CLICK HERE TO LOGIN** button, it will emit btnText input property value as as string. **For instance,** you have defined a button \n * with value as **CLICK HERE TO LOGIN**, it will emit it's value as string to the end user on click of this button. \n *\n
